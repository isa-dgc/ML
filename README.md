# Machine Learning Notebooks (in Portuguese)
This repository contains various Jupyter notebooks demonstrating machine learning algorithms using Python. While the explanations in the code cells are written in Portuguese, these notebooks cover a wide range of machine learning techniques for both classification and regression tasks, as well as model validation.

## Notebook Descriptions:
- Exemplo_RL.ipynb: Provides a practical example of Linear Regression (RL), showing how the model works for continuous variable prediction.

- Exemplos_ML.ipynb: An introductory collection of machine learning examples, offering a broad overview of different algorithms and techniques.

- KNN.ipynb: Implements the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, a classification method based on data point proximity.

- K_Means.ipynb: Demonstrates the K-Means clustering algorithm, commonly used for grouping data into clusters.

- Naive_Bayes.ipynb: A Naive Bayes classifier implementation, ideal for text classification and other categorization tasks.

- Random_Forest.ipynb: Applies the Random Forest algorithm, which combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

- Regressão_Linear.ipynb: Focused on Linear Regression, this notebook explains a simple model to predict continuous values based on independent variables.

- Regressão_Logística.ipynb: Explains and applies Logistic Regression, a popular algorithm for binary classification problems.

- SVM.ipynb: Implementation of Support Vector Machines (SVM), a powerful technique for classification tasks.

- Validacao_Cruzada.ipynb: Covers Cross-Validation, an essential method for model evaluation and avoiding overfitting.

- ÁrvoreDeDecisão.ipynb: Demonstrates Decision Tree modeling, a tree-structured approach for making predictions.

## Requirements
To run these notebooks, you'll need to install the following Python packages:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## You can install all dependencies with:

`pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn`

Each notebook is self-contained and can be run individually. Open any .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, Google Colab, or any compatible environment to execute and explore each algorithm step by step.
